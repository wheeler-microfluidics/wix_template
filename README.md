## Project contents ##

From the [website][2]:

> Logically the project is divided into 7 folders and 1 main file.
>
>   * `CustomActions`
>     * Stores WiX fragments that define different custom actions (CA's). You can
>       have 1 fragment per CA or all CA's under 1 fragment. I prefer fragment
>       per CA.
>   * `CustomDialogs`
>     * Stores WiX fragments that define our custom built dialogs. there are 2 we'll have:
>       * The overwritten existing EULA dialog.
>       * Fully custom product key check dialog.
>   * `Fragments`
>     * Stores WiX fragments that are either auto generated by Heat.exe directory
>       harvesting or manually built like inserting some values into the
>       registry.
>   * `Includes`
>     * Stores WiX include files that hold pre processor variables. Wxi files
>       must be included at the top of each wxs file you're using variables in.
>   * `Lang`
>     * Stores localization stuff.
>     * `en-us`: US English installer. Stores English EULA and custom localization file.
>   * `Packages`
>     * Output for the actual MSI's.
>     * `en-us`: stores the English MSI installer.
>   * `Resources`
>     * Stores different resources like icons, jpg's, etc' used in the installer.
>   * `App.wxs`
>     * Master installer files where all the magic happens.
>
> We also need to include some references:
>
>   * `App.CustomAction`
>     * Needed to run our custom actions stored in the `App.CustomAction.dll` project
>   * `WixNetFxExtension`
>     * Needed for conditional check if `.Net 3.5` is installed and abort if not.
>   * `WixUIExtension`
>     * Needed to include and modify any UI elements.
>   * `WixUtilExtension`
>     * Needed to run `CloseApplication` built in custom action.
>
> All non-`WiX` files (others than `wsx`, `wxi`, `wxl`) don't really need to be
> included in the project but I like to include them for clarity. This way we see
> exactly what is in the installer from the project itself.
